# Text-to-Speech-Project
A web-based Text to Speech converter built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript that transforms written text into spoken audio.


PROBLEM STATEMENT:-

Reading large amount of text for long periods can be difficult for many users, including those with visual impairments or learning difficulties.
There is a need for a simple,browser-based solution that can convert written text into spoken audio without requiring additional software installation.


PROJECT DESCRIPTION:-

This project is a web-based Text to Speech converter that allows users to enter text and listen to it as speech.
We use the HTML tags like textarea, button, div, head, body etc. to define the structure of the website.
Then add the styles to the HTML tags used to define the structure by selecting them with the help of given IDs and Classes.
Utilise the speechSynthesis API of the global window object and the SpeechSynthesisUtterance to create a utterance of the entered text.
Next, we use the speak() method of the speechSynthesis API to speak or play the created utterance as a speech.
Also we have to handle the errors efficiently if user have not provided any text to convert.
